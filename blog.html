                    <p>Taishoken Ramen is the first ramen shop I fell in love with after I moved to Japan. This is classic Shoyu Ramen served in a huge bowl with a generous portion of noodles. The flavor is a bit tangy from the lemon peel they add to the broth and goes really well with the menma (bamboo shoots), so I always order an extra side of menma everytime I go. This shop opened back in the 1950s, so it has a classic feel and even some classical music playing to fill the background.</p>

                    <p>If you think you can handle spicy food, then you have to check out Kikanbo Ramen. They are famous for their unique karashibi style ramen. It’s miso ramen mixed with red pepper and numb pepper which has an amazing kick you can’t find anywhere else. Kikanbo also has some of the best Chashu I’ve ever had with really thick and juicy pork. I always get the Tokusei (premium) ramen with extra numb pepper and red pepper.</p>

                    <p>A little bit out of the way, you can find one of my all time favorite Iei-kei ramen, Jiyugaoka Toraibu Ramen. Iei-kei ramen is also known as Yokohama style ramen which is a classic Tonkotsu (pork bone) and soy sauce ramen. The broth is thick and creamy and the noodles go with it perfectly. I usually go for the option with all the fixings, but I’ll go with the standard option if I’m feeling something more simple. Whatever you do, make sure to add some garlic or their black bean sauce. If you’re lucky, you might get a lollipop as you head out.</p>

                    <h4>PIN #4 Tsukemen Gonokami Seisakusho</h4>
                    <p>Slightly off the beaten path in Shinjuku, you can find one of the Tsukemen (Dipping Noodle) shops in Tokyo known as Tsukemen Gonokami Seisakusho. Unfortunately, you won’t be the only one on the hunt for this place, so be prepared to wait in a bit of a line. It’s 100% worth it though! It’s an amazing seafood based broth ramen, so I definitely recommend trying their Ebi (shrimp) ramen. They get a bit unconventional with some of their toppings, so if you're feeling a bit adventurous, you can add some tomato and pesto sauce.</p>

                    <h4>PIN #5 Mǎzilù Lanzhou Beef Noodles</h4>
                    <p>If you are looking to try something a bit different, head on over to Jimbocho for some classic Chinese style beef noodles. It’s a unique type of ramen from the Gansu Province in China famous for its Halal dishes. The menu is standard: beef, radisho, cilantro and chili oil, but you choose from 9 different types of noodles! I usually go for the #8 triangular shaped, but I occasionally grab the #6 which is flat and a bit wide. Definitely worth checking out since it’s the only Lanzhou beef noodle shop certified by the Chinese Government for its dedication to being authentic.</p>
