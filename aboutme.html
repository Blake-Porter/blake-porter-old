                        <p class="justify">Adventure is in his blood. After taking a spontaneous half year trip to Japan and Korea, Blake totally uprooted his life in Los Angeles and moved to Japan. He uses Tokyo as a base to travel around the country and also visit the rest of Asia. He has traveled extensively throughout Asia, Europe and North America and is constantly looking for the next place to go.
                        <br><br>If you were to sneak a peek into his computer, you’d stumble upon tons of spreadsheets on every location he’s traveled to and wants to travel to. He’s always super prepared when it comes to exploring the unknown. He has everything from what landmarks to checkout to timetables for busses in the middle of nowhere. It’s not that he needs to plan every trip down to the minute, but rather, he wants the ability to be flexible and make changes at a moments notice.
                        <br><br>Blake believes traveling is the best way to open your mind to new cultures and meet people from around the world with different perspectives. Life is boring without adventure and he is always ready for the next one.</p>
