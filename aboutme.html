                        <p class="justify"><p>After taking a spontaneous half year trip to Japan and Korea, Blake totally uprooted his life in Los Angeles and moved to Japan. He uses Tokyo as a base to travel around the country and also visit the rest of Asia. He has traveled extensively throughout Asia, Europe and North America and is constantly looking for the next place to go.<br><br>Blake is always super prepared when it comes to travel. He has tons of spreadsheets with everything from what landmarks to checkout to timetables for busses in the middle of nowhere. Itâ€™s not that he needs to plan every trip down to the minute, but rather, he wants the ability to be flexible and make last minute changes at a moments notice.<br><br>Blake believes experiencing different cultures and meeting people around the world is a way to open your mind and fulfil yourself. He takes pride in being able to plan comprehensive itineraries that cover various destinations without draining the bank so he can travel as much as possible.</p>
